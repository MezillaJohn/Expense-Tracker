# Expense-Tracker
This project is a simple expense tracker, you can keep track of you expenses, for record purpose, so you won't spend uneccessarily.
## What i used
1. I used Firebase as backend to store expenses so the data will remain even if you close the app and come back to it
2. I used react navigation for navigation.
3. i used expo/ionicons icon for icons.
