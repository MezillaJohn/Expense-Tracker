# Expense-Tracker
This project is a simple mobile expense tracker, you can keep track of you expenses, for record purpose, so you won't spend uneccessarily.
## What i used
1. React Native
2. I used Firebase as backend to store expenses so the data will remain even if you close the app and come back to it
3. I used react navigation for navigation.
4. i used expo/ionicons icon for icons.
